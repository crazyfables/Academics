# Academics

Language: Python
Other: Travis CI
Skill Level: Noob

This repository is being used as a training ground for yours truly. I'm not exactly new to python, but I'm a bit rusty.
I will be practicing what I know all over again and adding to that knowledge as I skill up.
Eventually I intend to use various libraries and services like amazon aws to create different web services with python.
I will also be testing other various tools like Travis CI to gain a better understanding of them.
Soon I hope to create full applications that exist in containers hosted on the AWS server I stand up.
